# Regional Sports Cultures in France: A Data-Driven Comparison

This project investigates how rugby in Occitanie and football in the Hauts-de-France express two distinct regional identities. The analysis combines spatial data, sociological frameworks, and historical context to understand how sports become territorial markers embedded in local cultures and social structures.

## Project Overview

The central research question is:

**How do rugby in Occitanie and football in the Hauts-de-France reveal different regional identities?**

Sports are approached as cultural systems shaped by territory, collective practices, and long-term social histories. Following an anthropological definition of culture as “a set of norms, symbolic productions and shared representations” (Coulangeon, 2022), the project examines how each sport functions as a regional identity vector.

## Analytical Methods

- Spatial distribution and density analysis  
- Ratio indicators for over-/under-representation by municipality size  
- Chi-square tests for structural differences  
- Comparative mapping of infrastructures  
- Cross-region comparison of youth sports education systems

These elements follow a comparative territorial logic, treating Occitanie as the primary case and the Hauts-de-France as a structural counterpoint.

## Key Findings

### 1. Divergent Historical Trajectories

- Football expanded in industrial regions through mining communities and paternalistic employers.  
- Rugby spread via urban elites before becoming rooted in small towns and rural communities across the South-West.

These dynamics are detailed in pages 2–7 of the *Idées & Recherches* document.

### 2. Marked Spatial Asymmetries

- Rugby displays a clear rural pattern in Occitanie, with over-representation in communes under 5,000 inhabitants and under-representation in larger ones.  
- Football remains strongly urban-centred in the Hauts-de-France, aligned with industrial metropolitan areas.

This contrast appears clearly in the maps and density plots of the *Carnet de Bord* (pages 24–26).

### 3. Educational-Offer Divergence

- The Hauts-de-France host four times more football school sections than rugby sections.  
- Occitanie shows the opposite trend, with 1.68 times more rugby sections than football.

A chi-square test (χ² = 31.97, p < .001) confirms that these differences are structurally significant.  
Supporting information is visible on page 1 of the *Sections Sportives Scolaires* note.

### 4. Sociological Interpretation

Drawing on Darbon’s anthropology of sports and Coulangeon’s cultural theory:

- **Rugby** functions as a communal culture emphasising embodied cohesion, local belonging, and ritualised sociability (e.g., “third half”).  
- **Football** reflects a working-class urban identity linked to industrial heritage and large-scale spectator communities.

These insights are synthesised in pages 18–23 of the *Carnet de Bord*.

## Conclusion

The combined spatial, historical, and sociological evidence shows that rugby in Occitanie and football in the Hauts-de-France embody two fundamentally different ways of constructing regional identity. Rugby reinforces a village-based communal culture rooted in rural territories, while football expresses an urban industrial social memory. The contrast demonstrates how sports act as cultural markers that shape and structure collective identities across regions.
